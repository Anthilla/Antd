#
#  Proxy server configuration
#
#  This entry controls the servers behaviour towards ALL other servers
#  to which it sends proxy requests.
#
proxy server {

#
#  If the NAS re-sends the request to us, we can immediately re-send
#  the proxy request to the end server.  To do so, use 'yes' here.
#
#  If this is set to 'no', then we send the retries on our own schedule,
#  and ignore any duplicate NAS requests.
#
#  If you want to have the server send proxy retries ONLY when the NAS
#  sends it's retries to the server, then set this to 'yes', and
#  set the other proxy configuration parameters to 0 (zero).
#
#  Additionally, if you want 'failover' to work, the server must manage
#  retries and timeouts.  Therefore, if this is set to yes, then no
#  failover functionality is possible.
#
	synchronous = no

#
#  The time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the proxy, before
#  re-sending the proxied request.
#
#  If this time is set too high, then the NAS may re-send the request,
#  or it may give up entirely, and reject the user.
#
#  If it is set too low, then the RADIUS server which receives the proxy
#  request will get kicked unnecessarily.
#
	retry_delay = 5

#
#  The number of retries to send before giving up, and sending a reject
#  message to the NAS.
#
	retry_count = 3

#
#  If the home server does not respond to any of the multiple retries,
#  then FreeRADIUS will stop sending it proxy requests, and mark it 'dead'.
#
#  If there are multiple entries configured for this realm, then the
#  server will fail-over to the next one listed.  If no more are listed,
#  then no requests will be proxied to that realm.
#
#
#  After a configurable 'dead_time', in seconds, FreeRADIUS will
#  speculatively mark the home server active, and start sending requests
#  to it again.
#
#  If this dead time is set too low, then you will lose requests,
#  as FreeRADIUS will quickly switch back to the home server, even if
#  it isn't up again.
#
#  If this dead time is set too high, then FreeRADIUS may take too long
#  to switch back to the primary home server.
#
#  Realistic values for this number are in the range of minutes to hours.
#  (60 to 3600)
#
	dead_time = 120

#  An ldflag attribute for all realms to be included in a round-robin 
#  setup must be specified, and that ldflag must be the same for all
#  realms of the same name.
#  Currently (0 or fail_over) and (1 or round_robin) are the 
#  supported values for ldflag.  Fail over is the default setup.
#
#  DO NOT INCLUDE LOCAL AUTH/ACCT HOST REALMS IN A ROUND-ROBIN QUEUE.


#
#  If all exact matching realms did not respond, we can try the
#  DEFAULT realm, too.  This is what the server normally does.
#
#  This behaviour may be undesired for some cases.  e.g. You are proxying
#  for two different ISP's, and then act as a general dial-up for Gric.
#  If one of the first two ISP's has their RADIUS server go down, you do
#  NOT want to proxy those requests to GRIC.  Instead, you probably want
#  to just drop the requests on the floor.  In that case, set this value
#  to 'no'.
#
#  allowed values: {yes, no}
#
	default_fallback = yes

#
#  Older versions of the server would pass proxy requests through the
#  'authorize' sections twice; once when the packet was received
#  from the NAS, and again after the reply was received from the home
#  server.  Now that we have a 'post_proxy' section, the replies from
#  the home server should be sent through that, instead of through
#  the 'authorize' section again.
#
#  However, for backwards compatibility, this behaviour is configurable.
#  The default configuration is 'no', because this option is deprecated
#  and will be removed in the future.
#
#  allowed values: {yes, no}
#
	post_proxy_authorize = no

#
#  Configuration for the proxy realms.
#
#  The information given here is used in conjunction with the 'realms'
#  file.  This format is preferred, as it is more flexible.  The realms
#  listed here take priority over those listed in the 'realms' file.

#  A standard realm entry. A request from "user@company.com" will be
#  sent to radius.company.com as "user", unless the 'nostrip'
#  configuration item is specified.  If the 'nostrip' configuration
#  item is specified, then the request will be proxied as
#  "user@company.com"
#
#realm company.com {
#	type		= radius
#	authhost	= radius.company.com:1600
#	accthost	= radius.company.com:1601
#	secret		= testing123
#}

#  A realm entry with an optional fail-over realm.  A request from
#  "user@isp2.com" will be sent to radius.isp2.com as "user@isp2.com",
#  because the 'nostrip' directive is specified for this realm.
#
#realm isp2.com {
#	type        = radius
#	authhost    = radius.isp2.com:1645
#	accthost    = radius.isp2.com:1646
#	secret      = TheirKey
#	nostrip
#}
#
#  The fail-over realm for isp2.com
#
#realm isp2.com {
#	type        = radius
#	authhost    = radius2.isp2.com:1645
#	accthost    = radius2.isp2.com:1646
#	secret      = TheirKey2
#	nostrip
#}

#
#  1st node serv.com...set up for round-robin.
#
#  The load balancing 'ldflag' attribute can be used to perform
#  load balancing.  Allowed values are 'fail_over' and 'round_robin'.
#
#  If there is no ldflag attribute, or it is set to 'fail_over', then
#  the realms are treated as "fail-over".  That is, the first matching
#  realm is used, unless it is down, in which case the realm "fails
#  over" to the second matching realm.  The process continues until an
#  active matching realm is found, OR the DEFAULT realm is returned.
#
#  If the ldflag attribute is set to 'round_robin', then all active
#  realms of the same name are put into a pool internally in the
#  server, and the proxied requests are evenly divided among the
#  realms in the pool.  For this to work, all realms of the same name
#  MUST have the same value of their 'ldflag' attributes.  Mixing up
#  different types of load balancing schemes for the same realm will
#  cause problems.
#
#  The round_robin load balancing method is a probabilistic method
#  which evenly scatters the requests among the home servers.
#
#  Note that you CANNOT include local auth/acct host realms in a
#  round-robin queue.  Having a server load balance requests to itself
#  doesn't make any sense, as it only doubles the amount of work
#  which is needed to be done.
#
#realm serv.com {
#	type        = radius
#	authhost    = radius.serv.com:1645
#	accthost    = radius.serv.com:1646
#	secret      = TheirKey
#	ldflag      = round_robin
#	nostrip
#}

#
#  Another node for serv.com
#
#realm serv.com {
#	type        = radius
#	authhost    = radius2.serv.com:1645
#	accthost    = radius2.serv.com:1646
#	secret      = TheirKey2
#	ldflag	    = round_robin
#	nostrip
#}

#
#  A third round-robin node realm for serv.com
#
#realm serv.com {
#	type        = radius
#	authhost    = radius3.serv.com:1645
#	accthost    = radius3.serv.com:1646
#	secret      = TheirKey2
#	ldflag      = round_robin
#	nostrip
#}
#
#

#
#  This is a local realm.  The requests are NOT proxied,
#  but instead are authenticated by the RADIUS server itself.
#
#  You don't need a secret if BOTH 'authhost' and 'accthost' are
#  set to LOCAL.
#
#realm bla.com {
#	type		= radius
#	authhost	= LOCAL
#	accthost	= LOCAL
#}

#
#  This is a sample entry for iPass.
#
#realm IPASS {
#	type		= radius
#	authhost	= ipass.server.hostname:11812
#	accthost	= ipass.server.hostname:11813
#
	#  The shared secret here must be the same
	#  value as the secret of the NetServer found in the
	#  /usr/ipass/raddb/clients file of your NetServer software.
#	secret		= mysecret
#	nostrip
#}

#
#  This realm is used mainly to cancel proxying.  You can have
#  the "realm suffix" module configured to proxy all requests for
#  a realm, and then later cancel the proxying, based on other
#  configuration.
#
#  For example, you want to terminate PEAP or EAP-TTLS locally,
#  you can add the following to the "users" file:
#
#  DEFAULT EAP-Type == PEAP, Proxy-To-Realm := LOCAL
#
realm LOCAL {
	type		= radius
	authhost	= LOCAL
	accthost	= LOCAL
}

#
#  This realm is for requests which don't have an explicit realm
#  prefix or suffix.  User names like "bob" will match this one.
#
#realm NULL {
#	type		= radius
#	authhost	= radius.company.com:1600
#	accthost	= radius.company.com:1601
#	secret		= testing123
#}

#
#  This realm is for ALL OTHER requests.
#
#realm DEFAULT {
#	type		= radius
#	authhost	= radius.company.com:1600
#	accthost	= radius.company.com:1601
#	secret		= testing123
#}
