# All lines starting with a hash (#) or empty lines are ignored.
# Uncomment parameters you want to change!
#
# All parameters configurable in this file are explained and their default

# General syntax: Parameter Value
# Value can be: true/false, number, or path
#
# Extra spaces and tabs are ignored.

#
# For reasons of security it is recommended to run a proxy program
# without root rights. It is recommended to create user that is not
# used by any other program.
#
# Default:
# USER havp
# GROUP havp

# If this is true HAVP is running as daemon in background.
# For testing you may run HAVP at your text console.
#
# Default:
# DAEMON true

#
# Process id (PID) of the main HAVP process is written to this file.
# Be sure that it is writeable by the user under which HAVP is running.
# /etc/init.d/havp script requires this to work.
#
# Default:
# PIDFILE /var/run/havp/havp.pid
PIDFILE /tmp/havp.pid

#
# For performance reasons several instances of HAVP have to run.
# Specify how many servers (child processes) are simultaneously
# listening on port PORT for a connection. Minimum value should be
# the peak requests-per-second expected + 5 for headroom.
#
# For single user home use, 8 should be minimum.
# For 500 users corporate use, start at 40.
#
# Value can and should be higher than recommended. Memory and
# CPU usage is only affected by the number of concurrent requests.
#
# More childs are automatically created when needed, up to MAXSERVERS.
#
# Default:
#SERVERNUMBER 8
# MAXSERVERS 100
SERVERNUMBER 8 
MAXSERVERS <xvar *SERVERNUMBER>

#
# Files where to log requests and info/errors.
# Needs to have write permission for HAVP user.
#
# Default:
# ACCESSLOG /var/log/havp/access.log
# ERRORLOG /var/log/havp/havp.log

#
# Syslog can be used instead of logging to file.
# For facilities and levels, see "man syslog".
#
# Default:
# USESYSLOG false
USESYSLOG true
SYSLOGNAME proxy
# SYSLOGFACILITY daemon
# SYSLOGLEVEL info

#
# true: Log every request to access log
# false: Log only viruses to access log
#
# Default:
# LOG_OKS true
LOG_OKS <xvar *LOG_OKS>
#
# Level of HAVP logging
#  0 = Only serious errors and information
#  1 = Less interesting information is included
#
# Default:
# LOGLEVEL 0

#
# Temporary scan file.
# This file must reside on a partition for which mandatory
# locking is enabled. For Linux, use "-o mand" in mount command.
# See "man mount" for details. Solaris does not need any special
# steps, it works directly.
#
# Specify absolute path to a file which name must contain "XXXXXX".
# These characters are used by system to create unique named files.
#
# Default:
# SCANTEMPFILE /var/tmp/havp/havp-XXXXXX
SCANTEMPFILE /Database/var/register/system/havp/tmp/havp-XXXXXX

#
# Directory for ClamAV and other scanner created tempfiles.
# Needs to be writable by HAVP user. Use ramdisk for best performance.
#
# Default:
TEMPDIR /var/register/system/havp/clamav.tmp

#
# HAVP reloads scanners virus database by receiving a signal
# (send SIGHUP to PID from PIDFILE, see "man kill") or after
# a specified period of time. Specify here the number of
# minutes to wait for reloading.
#
# This only affects library scanners (clamlib, trophie).
# Other scanners must be updated manually.
#
# Default:
# DBRELOAD 60 

#
# Run HAVP as transparent Proxy?
#
# If you don't know what this means read the mini-howto
# TransparentProxy written by Daniel Kiracofe.
# (e.g.: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/TransparentProxy.html)
# Definitely you have more to do than setting this to true.
# You are warned!
#
# Default:
# TRANSPARENT false
TRANSPARENT true

#
# Specify a parent proxy (e.g. Squid) HAVP should use.
#
# Default: NONE
# PARENTPROXY localhost
# PARENTPORT 3128

#
# Write X-Forwarded-For: to log instead of connecters IP?
#
# If HAVP is used as parent proxy by some other proxy, this allows
# to write the real users IP to log, instead of proxy IP.
#
# Default:
# FORWARDED_IP false

#
# Send X-Forwarded-For: header to servers?
#
# If client sent this header, FORWARDED_IP setting defines the value,
# then it is passed on. You might want to keep this disabled for security
# reasons. Enable this if you use your own parent proxy after HAVP, so it
# will see the original client IP.
#
# Disabling this also disables Via: header generation.
#
# Default:
# X_FORWARDED_FOR false

#
# Port HAVP is listening on.
#
# Default:
# PORT 8080
PORT <xvar /system/havp/PORT>

#
# IP address that HAVP listens on.
# Let it be undefined to bind all addresses.
#
# Default: NONE
# BIND_ADDRESS 127.0.0.1

#
# IP address used for sending outbound packets.
# Let it be undefined if you want OS to handle right address.
#
# Default: NONE
# SOURCE_ADDRESS 1.2.3.4

#
# Path to template files.
#
# Default:
# TEMPLATEPATH /usr/local/etc/havp/templates/en

#
# Set to true if you want to prefer Whitelist.
# If URL is Whitelisted, then Blacklist is ignored.
# Otherwise Blacklist is preferred.
#
# Default:
# WHITELISTFIRST true

#
# List of URLs not to scan.
#
# Default:
# WHITELIST /usr/local/etc/havp/whitelist
WHITELIST <xvar *WHITELIST>
#
# List of URLs that are denied access.
#
# Default:
# BLACKLIST /usr/local/etc/havp/blacklist
BLACKLIST <xvar *BLACKLIST>

#
# Is scanner error fatal?
#
# For example, archive types that are not supported by scanner
# may return error. Also if scanner has invalid pattern files etc.
#
# true: User gets error page
# false: No error is reported (viruses might not be detected)
#
# Default:
# FAILSCANERROR true
FAILSCANERROR false

#
# When scanning takes longer than this, it will be aborted.
# Timer is started after HAVP has fully received all data.
# If set too low, complex files/archives might produce timeout.
# Timeout is always a fatal error regardless of FAILSCANERROR.
#
# Time in minutes!
#
# Default:
# SCANNERTIMEOUT 10

#
# Allow HTTP Range requests?
#
# false: Broken downloads can NOT be resumed
# true: Broken downloads can be resumed
#
# Allowing Range is a security risk, because partial
# HTTP requests may not be properly scanned.
#
# Whitelisted sites are allowed to use Range in any case.
#
# Default:
# RANGE false

#
# If you really need more performance, you can disable scanning of
# JPG, GIF and PNG files. These are probably the most common files
# around, so it will save lots of CPU. But be warned, image exploits
# exist and more could be found. Think twice if you want to disable!
#
# Default:
# SCANIMAGES true
SCANIMAGES <xvar *SCANIMAGES>
#
# Temporary file will grow only up to this size. This means scanner
# will scan data until this limit is reached.
#
# There are two sides to this setting. By limiting the size, you gain
# performance, less waiting for big files and less needed temporary space.
# But there is slightly higher chance of virus slipping through (though
# scanning large archives should not be gateways function, HAVP is more
# geared towards small exploit detection etc).
#
# VALUE IN BYTES NOT KB OR MB!!!!
#  0 = No size limit
#
# Default:
MAXSCANSIZE <xvar *MAXSCANSIZE>

#
# Amount of data going to browser that is held back, until it
# is scanned. When we know file is clean, this held back data
# can be sent to browser. You can safely set bigger value, only
# thing you will notice is some "delay" in beginning of download.
# Virus found in files bigger than this might not produce HAVP
# error page, but result in a "broken" download.
#
# VALUE IN BYTES NOT KB OR MB!!!!
#
# Default:
# KEEPBACKBUFFER 200000

#
# This setting complements KEEPBACKBUFFER. It tells how many Seconds to
# initially receive data from server, before sending anything to client.
# Even trickling is not done before this time elapses. This way files that
# are received fast are more secure and user can get virus report page for
# files bigger than KEEPBACKBUFFER.
#
# Setting to 0 will disable this, and only KEEPBACKBUFFER is used.
#
# Default:
# KEEPBACKTIME 5

#
# After Trickling Time (seconds), some bytes are sent to browser
# to keep the connection alive. Trickling is not needed if timeouts
# are not expected for files smaller than KEEPBACKBUFFER, but it is
# recommended to set anyway.
#
# 0 = No Trickling
#
# Default:
# TRICKLING 30

#
# Send this many bytes to browser every TRICKLING seconds, see above
#
# Default:
# TRICKLINGBYTES 1

#
# Downloads larger than MAXDOWNLOADSIZE will be blocked.
# Only if not Whitelisted!
#
# VALUE IN BYTES NOT KB OR MB!!!!
#  0 = Unlimited Downloads
#
# Default:
# MAXDOWNLOADSIZE 0

#
# Space separated list of strings to partially match User-Agent: header.
# These are used for streaming content, so scanning is generally not needed
# and tempfiles grow unnecessary. Remember when enabled, that user could
# fake header and pass some scanning. HTTP Range requests are allowed for
# these, so players can seek content.
#
# You can uncomment here a list of most popular players.
#
# Default: NONE
# STREAMUSERAGENT Player Winamp iTunes QuickTime Audio RMA/ MAD/ Foobar2000 XMMS

#
# Bytes to scan from beginning of streams.
# When set to 0, STREAMUSERAGENT scanning will be completely disabled.
# It is not recommended as there are some exploits for players.
#
# Default:
# STREAMSCANSIZE 20000

#
# Whitelist specific viruses by case-insensitive substring match.
# For example, "Oversized." and "Encrypted." are good candidates,
# if you can't disable those checks any other way.
#
# Default: NONE
# IGNOREVIRUS Oversized. Encrypted. Phishing.
