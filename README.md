About
-----
 
Antd aims to be an application/configuration init and a configuration daemon. Antd can be invoked by the base init system just after entering a known minimum runlevel during boot. Antd will then execute base and applicative processes, settings, and then check the configuration. Antd can work both locally and in distributed environments. Antd uses noSQL for complex data management to start, control, and mmonitor parts of the system and application stack. Antd can also work with systemd or other init systems.

Antd is:
- written in C#
- based on [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) and [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) frameworks
- implemented as web service with REST API service and rendered web interface
- released under the BSD 3 license
- self hosted, no external webserver is needed

Antd is a single daemon to maintain the entire Linux/Unix appliance system (processes, clustering, configuration, and monitoring) using, whenever possible, shell commands, kernel related userspace commands, or direct access to Unix pseudo filesystems like <code>/proc</code>, <code>/sys</code>, and dbus.

### Project Goals
- Complete administration capabilities
- Easy to use for inspecting logs and managing services
- Swiss Knife all-in-one for administration, configuration and monitoring
- Scales from one machine to big cluster environments.
- Orchestrated execution and management of processes and applications in distributed environments
- Full machine administration and monitoring
- Unique interface throughout the application
- Hardware/OS/architecture independent

### Antd is inspired by:
- [Webmin](http://www.webmin.com/)
- [LuCI OpenWRT](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials)
- [Cockipt Project](http://cockipt-project.org)
- [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/using-coreos/) [fleet and etcd](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/blob/master)
- [Salt Stack](http://saltstack.com/community/) and its sub project [Salt Virt](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/virt/)
- [Witsbits](http://witsbits.com/)
- Any other kind of distributed configuration manager and system synchronizer out there

### Dependencies:
- [C5](https://github.com/sestoft/C5/)
- [DensoDb](https://github.com/ppossanzini/DensoDB) v3
- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [Owin](https://github.com/owin/owin)
- [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy)

Play with the code, submit patches, and file bugs when you come across them. Don't forget to send your ideas and feature requests too!

### Contribution Flow

This is an outline of what a contributor's workflow should look like:

- Create a new branch or fork the repository from where you want to start your work (usually Anthilla/Antd:master)
- Edit the code, testing your changes as you go
- Create a commit, making sure that your commit messages follow **OUR** standards (see below)
- Push your changes to your own branch/forked repository
- Ensure your code is stable and free of any application-breaking bugs
- Submit a pull request

Please be patient as it may take some time for us to review your code. If we have any questions, we will notify you through the active pull request.
